## About Me

Hi, I'm Harrison — a physics graduate and aspiring machine learning engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.
My goal is to build ML workflows using a range of algorithms, techniques, and frameworks to deepen my understanding of machine learning.
My interests span basketball analytics, athletic performance modeling, and physics-inspired systems — themes I plan to explore across many of my projects.
I'm currently focused on:
- Exploring popular ML algorithms and frameworks
- Designing config-driven, modular pipelines for training and inference
- Deploying models to the cloud with AWS services like SageMaker, S3, Glue, and Athena
This GitHub is my sandbox — I'm always experimenting, iterating, and learning. I welcome feedback, ideas, and collaboration.
