# AboutME
AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer Associate and Physics graduate specializing in reproducible, config-driven ML workflows that scale from local experimentation to cloud deployment. My physics background equips me to tackle complex, quantitative problems, while my AWS expertise enables me to build robust, production-ready ML solutions. I have hands-on experience with SageMaker pipelines, data preparation, model training, and monitoring, and I love integrating AWS services such as S3, Glue, Athena, and Kinesis into scalable, end-to-end workflows.
