## About Me

Hi, I'm Harrison — a physics graduate and aspiring machine learning engineer based in Melbourne, Australia. I'm passionate about building reproducible, production-ready ML workflows that bridge the gap between experimentation and deployment. Every project I take on is an opportunity to learn something new, refine my skills, and push the boundaries of what I can build.

My interests span basketball analytics, athletic performance modeling, and physics-inspired systems. I'm especially drawn to projects that combine statistics with real-world impact, whether it's predicting NBA player trajectories or designing scalable cloud pipelines.

I'm currently focused on:
- Exploring a wide range of ML algorithms and frameworks
- Developing config-driven, modular pipelines for training and inference
- Deploying models to the cloud using AWS services like SageMaker, S3, Glue, and Athena

This GitHub is my sandbox — I'm always working on something new, and I welcome feedback, ideas, and collaboration. If you're curious about data, sports, science, or just thoughtful machine learning, I’d love to connect.
